# Building a TODO List

Welcome to the Code Club! Here's the beginning of your very first project. Before we start, here's a few things to do first before we get started:

1. Get onboard our Slack team. This is where we can discuss anything code related or get help anytime. Ask me or send an email to **me (*AT*) patrick mann . com** and I'll get you added.
2. Make sure you have a github account and know how to make a repository. This is how we'll share code and manage your projects. Check out [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) if you're new to Github.

Here are also things to keep in mind:
- *Stuck?* Use Google. There are many solutions to the problem/thing you don't know. There are many people on the internet smarter then us.
- Don't forget *to ask for help* on the Slack chat. And if you *know the answer*, help out a bro.
- Take things at your own pace, while competition is good, *respect that we are all at different levels*.
- Each week there will be minimum goal, along with some additional challenges if you feel like stretching yourself. There are rumours that there will be a lame prize somewhere down the line...

# Week 1: 
A customer of yours is terribly unorganised and asks you to build a TO DO app to help organise their tasks.

## Goals: 
- As a user, I want to be able to create a to do list item
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a item as done

## Extension Challenges:
- Easy: 	When you close the app and reopen it, the items persist
- Medium: 	Set a due date for each item
- Medium: 	A button to sort list by name, date due and date created
- Hard:		Convert to an [Electron app](http://electron.atom.io/)


## Geting Started:
For this project, *we'll be developing in a web browser with HTML and Javascript*. I highly recommend using Chrome and getting familiar with the [inbuilt development tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

To build this web app, you can *use anything*. However for some, you're being thrown into the deep end so I'll make some suggestions:


### 1. Get a Good Text Editor
My personal favourites:
- Sublime Text (infinite free trial with occassional popup)
- Visual Studio Code (still in beta)

Other Recommendations:
- Notepad++
- IntelliJ 

### 2. Learn Javascript
Don't know Javascript? That's okay. Here is a [tutorial to get started with](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).

### 3. Use Some Helper Libraries
Writing plain javascript just isn't fun. I recommend trying to use either [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or [Mithril](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/getting-started.html). [Here is another decent intro for Mithril](http://ratfactor.com/daves-guide-to-mithril-js?/shire). 

If you get stuck, remember you can always *search up a guide* on how to make a simple todo app. There's no shame ;) There are a lot of guides.

If you'd like to try something a bit more complex/heavy, perhaps try [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I personally have more experience with Angular and can give you specific assistance. For this project I recommend sticking to Angular 1.4.


## Due Date
If you would like your work reviewed, and would like to score some points for completing challenges then submit your Github repo via the #review channel on Slack. Deadline closes 11:59pm 28th February (Sunday Night).
