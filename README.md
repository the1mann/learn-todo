# Building a TODO List

Welcome to the Code Club! Here's the beginning of your very first project. Before we start, here's a few things to do first before we get started:

1. Get onboard our Slack team. This is where we can discuss anything code related or get help anytime. Ask me or send an email to **me (*AT*) patrick mann . com** and I'll get you added.
2. Make sure you have a github account and know how to make a repository. This is how we'll share code and manage your projects. Check out [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) if you're new to Github.

Here are also things to keep in mind:
- *Stuck?* Use Google. There are many solutions to the problem/thing you don't know. There are many people on the internet smarter then us.
- Don't forget *to ask for help* on the Slack chat. And if you *know the answer*, help out a bro.
- Take things at your own pace, while competition is good, *respect that we are all at different levels*.
- Each week there will be minimum goal, along with some additional challenges if you feel like stretching yourself. There are rumours that there will be a lame prize somewhere down the line...

# Geting Started:
For this project, *we'll be developing in a web browser with HTML and Javascript*. I highly recommend using Chrome and getting familiar with the [inbuilt development tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

To build this web app, you can *use anything*. However for some, you're being thrown into the deep end so I'll make some suggestions:


## 1. Get a Good Text Editor
My personal favourites:
- Sublime Text (infinite free trial with occassional popup)
- Visual Studio Code (still in beta)

Other Recommendations:
- Notepad++
- IntelliJ 

## 2. Learn Javascript
Don't know Javascript? That's okay. Here is a [tutorial to get started with](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).

## 3. Use Some Helper Libraries
Writing plain javascript just isn't fun. I recommend trying to use either [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or [Mithril](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/getting-started.html). [Here is another decent intro for Mithril](http://ratfactor.com/daves-guide-to-mithril-js?/shire). 

If you get stuck, remember you can always *search up a guide* on how to make a simple todo app. There's no shame ;) There are a lot of guides.

If you'd like to try something a bit more complex/heavy, perhaps try [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I personally have more experience with Angular and can give you specific assistance. For this project I recommend sticking to Angular 1.4.

# Week 1: 
A customer of yours is terribly unorganised and asks you to build a TO DO app to help organise their tasks.

## Goals: 
- As a user, I want to be able to create a to do list item
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a item as done

## Extension Challenges:
- Easy: 	When you close the app and reopen it, the items persist
- Medium: 	Set a due date for each item
- Medium: 	A button to sort list by name, date due and date created
- Hard:		Convert to an [Electron app](http://electron.atom.io/)

## Due Date
If you would like your work reviewed, and would like to score some points for completing challenges then submit your Github repo via the #review channel on Slack. Deadline closes 11:59pm 28th February (Sunday Night).

# Week 2: 
The customer is so excited to get your little web app. Buuuut... they think it needs a few more features.

## Goals: 
- As a user, I want to be able to search my todo items by their title
- As a user, I want done items to be hidden, but a page to see all done items so I set it back to un-done

## Extension Challenges:
- Easy: 	Write a readme file for your project
- Easy:		As a user, I want to delete todo items
- Medium: 	As a user, I want to be able to put my todo list item into a category when I create it so I can see them grouped
- Medium:	How does your search handle hundreds of todo list items? Why does it get slower the more items you have? Write up a paragraph about this and ideas for how you could improve performance with large amounts of data.
- Hard:		As a user, I want to be able to drag around the todo list items so I can put them in my own order

## Due Date
If you would like your work reviewed, and would like to score some points for completing challenges then submit your Github repo via the #review channel on Slack. Deadline closes 11:59pm 4th March (Sunday Night).

# Week 3 and 4: 
The customer now wants to get it working on her phone, laptop at home and her computer at work. To the cloud!

## Goals: 
- As a user, I want to be able to login so I can see my todo list items from any device

## Extension Challenges:
- Easy: Allow any user to create an account and store their own private todo lists
- Medium: Host your website online somewhere
- Hard: Allow users to create an account using Facebook

## Geting Started:
For this week's goal, I recommend using [Firebase](www.firebase.com) for handing your login and database. The main challenges of this week are authentication and using API's (Application Programming Interfaces). If you can finish this week's goal you're well on your way to being able to build modern apps easily using off the shelf parts.

If you like a hard challenge, you can choose to build the backend yourself. Good luck getting that done in 7 days though.


## Due Date
If you would like your work reviewed, and would like to score some points for completing challenges then submit your Github repo via the #review channel on Slack. Deadline closes 11:59pm 4th March (Sunday Night). You will need to provide in your readme either how I can login or create an account (not required).
